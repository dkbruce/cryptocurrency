# DATA ANALYTICS BOOT CAMP - PROJECT 2

## Cryptocurrency Values over Time
### Margaret Oluwatoyin sippiotitiloyeola, Dylan Bruce, and Mirella Mardakis


## Purpose: 
	The purpose of this project is to display the values per day for the past six year of four popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Neo, and Iota.

## Extract:
	We extracted four separate CSV files from Kaggle.com. 

## Transform: 
	We converted the CSV files into Pandas dataframes, deciding to use all the existing columns, as the information is relevant to analyzing value fluctuations over time.

## Load:
	The data is loaded into a MySQL relational database. This type of database works best for displaying financial trends because it makes joining tables and manipulating numerical data very easy, and this type of information is more efficiently displayed in tables.
